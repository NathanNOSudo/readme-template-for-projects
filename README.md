<!-- PROJECT SHIELDS -->
<!--
*** I'm using markdown "reference style" links for readability.
*** Reference links are enclosed in brackets [ ] instead of parentheses ( ).
*** See the bottom of this document for the declaration of the reference variables along with a few blank ones just needing content
*** for contributors-url, forks-url, etc. This is an optional, concise syntax you may use. Your editor may have an extension availabale. VSCode does for sure. You can add badges like ordinary snippets by pressing a few keys.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

I put this together to show what a detailed README is like. This README is written and styled in Markdown.  You can edit this eitehr in the browser or your code editor. VScode does have a Markdown extension which will show you the syntax highlighting.

Why doing this detailed README is important:
* Recruiters who looks at your project might not know how to reade code.
* You an reuse it over and over again. Save time and work on your projects more by just editing this to match your next project!
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:


Here's a blank template to get started:
**To avoid retyping too much info. Do a search and replace with your text editor for the following:**
`github_username`, `repo_name`, `twitter_handle`, `email`


### Built With
* [JavaScript](https://javascript.com)
